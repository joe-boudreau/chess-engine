/**
 * Pre-computed values used in ChessEngine class. Some are for convenience, but
 * this class is depended on by ChessEngine to compute the necessary attack sets
 * for sliding piece bestMove generation. Most of the code for that, which involves
 * something referred to as "magic bitboards", is based off a perfact hashing
 * algorithm for quick efficient bestMove sets. I got the algorithm from the following
 * blog:
 * http://www.afewmorelines.com/understanding-magic-bitboards-in-chess-programming/
 * But there were a number of changes I needed to make to the code for it to run
 * in my framework.
 * 
 * Everything here is based off the following bitboard representation:
 * 
 * 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63
 * 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55
 * 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47
 * 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39
 * 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
 * 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
 * 8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15
 * 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
 * 
 * where the 64-bits in the long represent the following:
 * 
 * MSb [63, 62, 61 .. 0] LSb
 * 
 * For example, all the squares in the bottom row, a.k.a Rank 1, could be represented
 * as the long value 0xffL, or in binary 0b11111111L, since those are the 8 least significant
 * digits

     * Generates every occupancy variation for a particular square for both bishops

     * occupancy variation.
     *
     * For example, the following are two possible occupancy variations for a rook
     * on square 2:
     *
     * Variation 1 (Rook - square 2)
     *   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 1 R 0 1 0 1 0
     *
     *   Variation 2 (Rook - square 2)
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   1 1 R 0 1 0 0 0
     *
     *   However, both these occupancy variations produce the same resulting attack
     *   set for rooks, which is shown below
     *
     *   Attack set (Rook - square 2)
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 1 R 0 1 0 0 0
     *
     *   The purpose of the attack set is to define the boundaries of the rays for the
     *   sliding piece in every direction based off the positions of all the other
     *   pieces on the board. Once this is determined, the blocking pieces which define
     *   the boundaries of the attack set just need to be checked to find out if they
     *   are capturable or not, or in other words if they are enemy pieces or friendly
     *   pieces.
     *
     * The number of occupancy variations for a particular piece on a square is just
     * the total number of different permutations of pieces existing on the possible
     * destination squares for a piece on a square. This is simply 2^(number of
     * destination squares on the mask). For example, for the rook on Square 2, the
     * destination square mask looks like this:
     *   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
     *   0 1 R 1 1 1 1 0
     *
     * Since this mask has 11 bits set in it, the amount of different occupancy
     * variations for this square will be 2^11.

     * Magic Numbers are generated using a perfect hashing technique. Every occupancy
     * variation is mapped to its corresponding attack set through operations involving
     * a "magic number" which is specific to each square. This function searches for
     * and stores the magic numbers which will be used during bestMove generation for this
     * purpose. Given the occupancy of pieces on the board, perform the operations using
     * the magic number to instantly return the attack set that represents the possible
     * squares the sliding piece can bestMove to.
     *
     * There is one magic number for each square and sliding piece type combination (rook
     * or bishop), which means that in total there are 2 x 64 = 128 magic numbers that need
     * to be computed.
     *
     * For each of these piece type and square combinations, there is a magic number, M, such
     * that the following conditions hold:
     *
     * For every occupancy variation (v) and corresponding attack set (A) pair, [v, A], which
     * were computed in the function 'generateoccupancyVariations()' above, the following holds:
     *
     *
     * F(v, M) --> I
     * G(I) --> A
     *
     * where F is a function that generates an index, I, and G is an array which returns the correct
     * attack set A. Note that since multiple occupancy variations can map to the same attack set A,
     * then if F returns the same I for two different variations v and v', this is acceptable as long
     * as both v and v' correspond to the same attack set A.
